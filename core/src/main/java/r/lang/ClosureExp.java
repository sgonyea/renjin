   * argument match several actuals or vice versa.</li>
   *
   * <li><strong>Partial matching on tags.</strong> Each remaining named supplied argument is compared to the
   * remaining formal arguments using partial matching. If the name of the supplied argument
   * matches exactly with the first part of a formal argument then the two arguments are considered
   * to be matched. It is an error to have multiple partial matches.
   *  Notice that if f <- function(fumble, fooey) fbody, then f(f = 1, fo = 2) is illegal,
   * even though the 2nd actual argument only matches fooey. f(f = 1, fooey = 2) is legal
   * though since the second argument matches exactly and is removed from consideration for
   * partial matching. If the formal arguments contain ‘...’ then partial matching is only applied to
   * arguments that precede it.
   *
   * <li><strong>Positional matching.</strong> Any unmatched formal arguments are bound to unnamed supplied arguments,
   * in order. If there is a ‘...’ argument, it will take up the remaining arguments, tagged or not.
   * If any arguments remain unmatched an error is declared.
   *
   * @param actuals the actual arguments supplied to the list
   * @param env the environment in which to resolve the arguments
